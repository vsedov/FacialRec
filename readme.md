# What is this ? 
This is a A level project that i had made a very long time ago, back in 2019. 
This project took hand in allot of resources and tutorials and is not all my work . As mentioned Below, i had no clue
what i was doing at this time. 


# Is this viable ?
  No : this is a project that was made when i had zero clue about machine learning or facial recognition, I wasnt even
  amazing at python at that time. This was a project to test my understanding and my abilities. I want to be able to
  move forward within the field of machine learning and this was the first step for me to get first hand practice. 

# How do i Run it ? 
  Well, considering that this project was not made with poetry, it will be rather hard to run. If you really do wish to
  run this. Please make a issues, and il convert this into a poetry project.
